A design system created with Figma, React and Storybook during Rocketseat's Ignite Lab

## Description
During the event, we deveoped a design system using Figma, React and Storybook. 
With Figma, we created the design itself, we also created dynamic components that allowed us to control and customize parts of the design in real time.
With Storybook, we were able to create a documentation for our components.

## Future plans
- Add more components
- Customize the layout
